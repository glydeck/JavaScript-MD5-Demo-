# Demonstration of Using MD5 in a Web Page
### Description
This is a simple demonstration of how to use the JavaScript implementation of the MD5 hashing algorithm. MD5 was designed by Ronald Rivest in 1991 to replace an earlier hash function MD4, and was specified in 1992 as RFC 1321. MD5 can be used as a checksum to verify data integrity against unintentional corruption. Historically it was widely used as a cryptographic hash function; however it has been found to suffer from extensive vulnerabilities such as collisions.
